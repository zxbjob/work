RangeBar
=======
The RangeBar is similar to an enhanced SeekBar widget, though it doesn't make use of the SeekBar. It provides for the selection of a range of values rather than a single value. The selectable range values are discrete values designated by tick marks; the thumb (handle) will snap to the nearest tick mark.

Developers can customize the following attributes (both via XML and programmatically):

- bar color
- bar thickness
- tick height
- number of ticks
- connecting line thickness
- connecting line color
- thumb normal image
- thumb pressed image

If any of the following attributes are specified, the thumb images will be ignored and be replaced with a circle whose properties can be specified as follows:
- thumb radius
- thumb normal color
- thumb pressed color

Finally, the following property can be set programmatically, but not via XML:
- thumb indices (the location of the thumbs on the RangeBar)

Supported on API Level 7 and above.
